\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Problem Statement :}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Activity detection is a major problem in smart videos surveillance. It is a fundamental problem in computer vision, i.e. to detect the activity of human in surveillance videos. These applicants need real-time detection performance, but it is generally very time consuming to detect the actual activity.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction :}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Video surveillance is one of the most obvious security measures we see on a daily basis.Video surveillance is a rapidly growing industry. Driven by low-hardware costs,heightened security fears and increased capabilities; video surveillance equipment is being deployed ever more widely, and with ever greater storage and ability for recall. It allow some distinction between “privacy intrusive” and “privacy neutral” video data that can be the basis for protecting privacy in video surveillance systems .
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Literature review : }
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Method for gathering the Real time Camera streams.
    \item Implementation of Closed-circuit Television(CCTV) Using Wireless     Internet Protocol (IP).
    \item The Design and Implementation of a Wireless Video Surveillance System.
    \item IOT based Smart Surveillance System.
    \item AUTOMATION IN SURVEILLANCE.
    \item ANALYZING TECHNIQUES.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{System Architecture :}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Video surveillance systems are considered one of the most reliable methods of protecting various places.[1]
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5cm,height=4cm]{Monitoring system based on DVR (1) (1).png}
    \caption{Monitoring system based on DVR}
    \label{fig:DVR}
\end{figure}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item first of all the necessity of providing an individual cable for each camera, the second - limited number of channels (the next ones will require another DVR), and finally - one monitoring center (with the DVR inside).
    \item Transmission technique based on division of signals into packets allows to reach a new functionality of video monitoring systems. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5cm,height=4cm]{Monitoring system based on DVRs with network interfaces.png}
    \caption{Monitoring system based on DVRs with network interfaces}
    \label{fig:DVR}
\end{figure}

\item  
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advanced solutions allow to control a number of DVRs, which can be utilized in large installations.But there is still the problem of providing an individual cable for each camera.
    \item To solve the problems caused by analog video transmission from CCTV   cameras, one should use devices dedicated for work in IP networks. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5cm,height=4cm]{IP CCTV system based on client software.png}
    \caption{IP CCTV system based on client software}
    \label{fig:DVR}
\end{figure}
    \item The problem can be partially solved using devices with Dual Stream function. They allow to transmit two streams with independently determined parameters.
    \item This architecture limits the number of simultaneous connections among the users (clients) and the the cameras. The best solution seems to be client-server architecture.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5cm,height=4cm]{IP CCTV system using Dual Stream devices.png}
    \caption{IP CCTV system using Dual Stream devices}
    \label{fig:DVR}
\end{figure}
    \item  This architecture allows to build very efficient installations where cameras and video servers are connected to one or more servers.The servers are responsible for managing the system, the clients connect only with them.The main advantage of this solution is isolation of cameras and the links between the cameras and servers from outgoing traffic.

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Additionally, extension of the system by connecting next cameras and servers does not affects client stations which are capable of connecting to many servers at the same time.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5cm,height=4cm]{IP CCTV system based on server - client architecture.png}
    \caption{IP CCTV system based on server - client architecture}
    \label{fig:DVR}
\end{figure}
    \item The only problem of this architecture may be a failure of the managing server, which would break connection between cameras and clients. It can be overcome by using highly reliable servers
    
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Each of the concepts presented above is suitable for different applications. The systems based on DVRs are usually used in single buildings
    \item In the case of distributed systems there are very important transmission parameters of IP devices and the network. Depending on the number and deployment of clients there is used adequate managing software.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Algorithms :}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Viola-Jones algorithm :}Facial detection via the Viola-Jones algorithm is a common method used due to its high detection rate and fast processing speed. The algorithm can be summed up in four steps: feature selection, feature evaluation, feature learning to create a classifier, and cascading classifiers.
    \item {\bf LBPH algorithm :}The Local Binary Pattern Histogram(LBPH) algorithm is a simple solution on face recognition problem, which can recognize both front face and side face.
    \item {\bf R-CNNs(Region based CNNs):}Instead of working on a massive number of regions,or going through each and every pixel and localised part of the image to search for the presence of an object.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Region-based Fully Convolutional Network(R-FCN) : } R-FCN is a region-based detector for object detection.this region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost all computation shared on the entire image.
    \item {\bf YOLO (You Only Look Once) :}You Only Look Once or YOLO is one of the popular algorithms in object detection used by the researchers around the globe. According to the researchers at Facebook AI Research, the unified architecture of YOLO is extremely fast in manner.
